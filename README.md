# IOT-Aquaponics-in-NYC
I want to serve my friends salad that I grew myself, fertilized with fish poop from fish I own, in one connected aquaponic/RAS system. Is it worth thinking about a project for months and then giving up even getting started? Sometimes. This one was at risk for me, but I don't think I'll be ditching it just yet because I have a trick up my sleeve: prototyping.   This first stab at home-grown fish poop salad is meant to be all wrong (or right, depending on your outlook): filled with hacks, peer borrowing, corners cut, and definitely ugly on the eyes.
